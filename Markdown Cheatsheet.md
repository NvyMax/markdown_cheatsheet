#What is MarkDown?
> Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).  - John Gruber

# Headlines 
    " #_Space_Text"

# Headings & Paragraphs

## Heading Level 2

### Heading Level 3

#### Heading Level 4

##### Heading Level 5

###### Heading Level 6

## Paragraphs and Line Breaks

We create paragraphs by typing the normal way. Enter twice to start a new paragraph.

Empty spaces between blocks of text = lines of emptiness in your document (empty line = line break = same as "<'br'>")

### Emphasis and Bolding

#### Italics (emphasis)
This *works* and _works_ (asterisks or underscore)

#### Bolding

This **works** and __works__ too () (double asterisks or double underscore)

***BOTH*** or ___both___


#### Blockquotes

>This is a quote
> to link spaced paragraphs that are quoted put the greter than sign in the paragraph space line
>
> ^ like that up there.

#### Horizontal Rules

underscores, hypens or asterisks can make horizontal lines

## Final Notes
Markdown varies slighty depending on the type and location such as GitHub flavor Markdown.  This is also called Markdown Flavor and can sometimes be driven by the type of parser that is linked to the site.
