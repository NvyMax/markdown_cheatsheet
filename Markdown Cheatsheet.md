# What is MarkDown?
> Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).  - John Gruber

# Headlines 
    " #_Space_Text"

# Headings & Paragraphs

## Heading Level 2

### Heading Level 3

#### Heading Level 4

##### Heading Level 5

###### Heading Level 6

## Paragraphs and Line Breaks

We create paragraphs by typing the normal way. Enter twice to start a new paragraph.

Empty spaces between blocks of text = lines of emptiness in your document (empty line = line break = same as "<'br'>")

### Emphasis and Bolding

#### Italics (emphasis)
This *works* and _works_ (asterisks or underscore)

#### Bolding

This **works** and __works__ too () (double asterisks or double underscore)

***BOTH*** or ___both___

### Other Formatting

#### Blockquotes

>This is a quote
> to link spaced paragraphs that are quoted put the greater- than sign in the line space between paragraphs.
>
> ^ like that up there.

#### Horizontal Rules

use underscores, hypens or asterisks to make horizontal lines of separation

3 = golden

## Code

To display code correctly in Markdown, use backticks before and after the code.

### Inline code

`one backtick`

A single backtick works to do inline coding
but three backticks works better and will use the sites formatting for code blocks.

```
three backticks before and after for code blocks
```
### Language identified code
```Javascript
for (var i = 0; i >= 10; i++) {
    console.log('When you write it like this, is looks like formatted JS.
    if you put the language name after the first set of backticks' your code will parse accodingly)
}

```

] (https://nvy.io) (this [] around everything, allows for a displayed image with a link to the image when pressed, the parenthesis is the redirect when clicked)

![Doggies](https://nvy.io/images/doggies.png/300/400 "This is a title for an image") (after the sizing options use quotes to add an image title)

## Final Notes
Markdown varies slighty depending on the type and location such as GitHub flavor Markdown.  This is also called Markdown Flavor and can sometimes be driven by the type of parser that is linked to the site.
